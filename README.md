<h2> Transfer Learning </h2>
<h5> build by reusing lower layers of Xception Model </h5>

This dataset consists of __1984 images__ belonging to two classes:
<br>
*	__with_mask: 984 images__
*	__without_mask: 1000 images__

<h4> Data Augmentation </h4>
Used Data Augmentation to reduce overfitting and improve performance even on poor lighting condition.
