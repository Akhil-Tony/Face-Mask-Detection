<h1 align="center">Face Mask Detection</h1>
<h4>Face Mask Detection System built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in static images as well as in real-time video streams.</h4>

## :star: Features
Our face mask detector doesn't use any morphed masked images dataset and the model is accurate. Owing to the use of MobileNetV2 architecture, it is computationally efficient, thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

This dataset consists of __4095 images__ belonging to two classes:
*	__with_mask: 2165 images__
*	__without_mask: 1930 images__
